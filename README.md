# Pymaceuticals-challenge

Initally I found difficulty in using loc to narrow down the DataFrame to filter and find the data I was looking for. 
After using it more and more it became a lot easier to comprehend the structure. 
The most confusing part was the punctuation due to the amount of brackets and parentheses required in certain lines of code.
Furthermore understanding the inputs the two different plotting methods required also took some time. The code form for plots were simple but structuring your data in a way that they both could be used was challenging.
Besides those two the rest of the challenge went smoothly.
The iqr and correlation was straightforward with a lot of plug and chugging in the variables.
